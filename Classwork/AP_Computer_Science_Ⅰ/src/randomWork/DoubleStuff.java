/**
 * This class is used to demonstrate how doubles behave under unusual
 * circumstances. Inspect the code and determine what it will do. - How is
 * division by zero handled? - Are theoretically equal doubles always equal in
 * practice? - How can setting a tolerance be used check equality with doubles?
 * Exercise: How many terms does it take for the series below to converge to
 * within 0.00001 of 2 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + â€¦
