# Java_Development
A collection of all the work I have done and will do with Java (primarily).
## `Classwork`
This repository is for work which I have done for school, and will be updated very frequently.
### Folder Labeling

Any new immediate sub-folders created in this folder will be labeled with the span of the school year.
## `HelloWorld`
This branch is dead, but a good example of a beginner-level program.
## `RandomWork`
This is for personal projects, and will not be updated as frequently.
## out
This contains the .class files for all of the Java programs in this repository, all of which are compiled in at least JDK 13.0.1.
